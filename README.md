# Library Checkout System

This is a Python FastAPI project that manages a library checkout system using SQLite as the database.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `app/`: This directory contains the main application code.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `app` package.
  - `main.py`: Entry point of the FastAPI application. It creates an instance of the FastAPI app, sets up the database connection, and includes the routers.
  - `models/`: This directory contains the model classes.
    - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `models` package.
    - `author.py`: Defines the `Author` model class. The `Author` model has fields such as `id`, `name`, and `books` (a relationship to the `Book` model).
    - `book.py`: Defines the `Book` model class. The `Book` model has fields such as `id`, `title`, `availability`, and `author_id` (a foreign key to the `Author` model).
    - `checkout.py`: Defines the `Checkout` model class. The `Checkout` model has fields such as `id`, `book_id` (a foreign key to the `Book` model), `checkout_date`, and `return_date`.
  - `routers/`: This directory contains the router classes.
    - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `routers` package.
    - `author.py`: Defines the router for handling CRUD operations related to authors. It includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting authors.
    - `book.py`: Defines the router for handling CRUD operations related to books. It includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.
    - `checkout.py`: Defines the router for handling CRUD operations related to checkouts. It includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting checkouts.
  - `schemas/`: This directory contains the Pydantic models for validating and serializing data.
    - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `schemas` package.
    - `author.py`: Defines the `AuthorCreate`, `AuthorUpdate`, and `Author` Pydantic models.
    - `book.py`: Defines the `BookCreate`, `BookUpdate`, and `Book` Pydantic models.
    - `checkout.py`: Defines the `CheckoutCreate`, `CheckoutUpdate`, and `Checkout` Pydantic models.
  - `database.py`: Defines the database connection and session setup using SQLite as the database.
- `alembic/`: This directory contains the database migration scripts.
  - `env.py`: Configuration file for Alembic. It sets up the database connection and includes the migration scripts.
  - `script.py.mako`: Template file used by Alembic to generate migration scripts.
  - `versions/`: Directory that contains the migration scripts generated by Alembic.
- `alembic.ini`: Configuration file for Alembic. It specifies the database URL and other Alembic settings.
- `requirements.txt`: File that lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for the project.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-checkout-system.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the FastAPI application: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

You can now access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `/authors`: CRUD operations for authors.
- `/books`: CRUD operations for books.
- `/checkouts`: CRUD operations for checkouts.

Please refer to the API documentation for more details on how to use the endpoints.

## Database Migration

This project uses Alembic for database migration. To apply the initial migration and create the database tables, run the following command:

```
alembic upgrade head
```
